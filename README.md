<h1>ForgeDock</h1>

<p><strong>Point it at an issue and get a merged, reviewed PR; point it at a <strong>milestone</strong> and get parallel pipelines with conflict-aware scheduling.</strong></p>

<p>LLMs generate the code. ForgeDock owns everything else — <strong>state, scheduling, recovery, review, and memory</strong> — as durable, inspectable structure on the GitHub you already have.

**This repository builds itself with ForgeDock.** In its first 30 days (June 4 → July 4, 2026): **693 issues filed, 605 closed, 603 PRs merged — median 56 minutes from open to merged-and-closed.** 57% of those issues were filed by the pipeline itself; 49% are findings its own review agents raised, filed, and then fixed. Every run leaves a public audit trail — [click through the receipts](#watch-the-machine-work), or count them yourself:

```bash
gh issue list -R RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock --state closed --limit 1000 --json number --jq 'length'
```

**A single run, up close** — a real one, [issue #1230](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1230):

```console
$ /work-on #1230        "orchestrate: Layer 5 co-change signal is dead code"

  ✓ investigate    CONFIRMED/HIGH — feature shipped 3h earlier (PR #1204) reads a
                   never-populated variable; the co-change query can never fire
  ✓ build          fix branch, 1 file
  ✓ review         caught a defect in the fix itself: stray backticks in the grep
                   meant every git-log pathspec silently matched zero commits —
                   "the fix would not have actually worked." Corrected.
  ✓ merged         30m 37s → staging

  filed by the pipeline's own staging review. fixed before a human read it.
```

### Launch the ForgeDock terminal

**Requires:** [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (authenticated), Node.js ≥ 22.19, and credentials for any Pi-supported model provider.

```bash
npx forgedock
```

When testing unpublished changes from a source checkout, use the checkout-safe launcher instead:

```bash
npm run terminal
```

`npx forgedock` resolves the installed/cached registry package; it does not implicitly run unpublished files from the current repository. Use `/forgedock-runtime` to verify the `semantic-tools+live-subagents-v2` runtime, bundled delegation bridge, and resolved package root on demand; the idle terminal does not reserve space for a persistent runtime widget.

When orchestration is active, press `←` or `↓` on an empty editor to focus the worker fleet, select a worker, and press `Enter` to open its live controller transcript. ForgeDock expands tool arguments and streaming output by default; press `x` (or `Ctrl+O`) to toggle the compact view.

ForgeDock now ships a source-maintained [Pi fork](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/pi) with ForgeDock's Chrome & Ember identity. First launch guides you through terminal appearance, provider authentication, and explicit model selection. The terminal exposes native `/deep-plan` plus controller-backed `/work-on`, `/review-pr`, `/orchestrate`, and `/forgedock-status` commands. `/deep-plan` runs a confirmation-gated planning interview; only a separate post-confirmation `materialize` action, bound to the exact confirmed packet and an explicit `owner/repo`, can create the idempotent GitHub issue DAG. Materialization returns an orchestration-ready handoff but never dispatches workers. Each command lazily activates its own semantic native tool, so the selected model can interpret natural-language intent without loading large Markdown workflow specs into every conversation. Direct work and review runs start as native background controller tasks by default. Normal TUI shutdown detaches still-running native tasks so a later local supervisor can reconcile or adopt them; `/forgedock-tasks cancel <task-id>` remains an explicit process-tree cancellation. Standalone `/review-pr` is deliberately read-only and reports findings only; automatic remediation belongs to the originating `/work-on` run. CLI and TUI orchestration share one typed durable controller for DAG execution, attempts, recovery, and persistence while retaining their respective scope-selection adapters. Use native DAG status/resume or `forgedock-next status --orchestration <dag-id>` and `forgedock-next orchestrate --resume <dag-id>` after interruption. Completed nodes remain completed, live native workers are reconciled before any relaunch, and only interrupted work is relaunched through typed work-on recovery. The scheduler caps dispatch to transport capacity, preserves frozen lane/target/plan/model metadata, derives stable serialization edges from path/component claims, and streams the live ready set as predecessors finish. A successful batch Outcome is projected to every member before the controller closes the member issues.

Verification is serialized across ForgeDock runs on the machine, Node test fanout is bounded, and timeout/cancellation terminates the complete subprocess tree rather than orphaning workers. Subagent transcripts stay in temporary operational storage instead of delivery worktrees, and automatic remediation cannot expand beyond the frozen Build Packet.

`forge.yaml` remains the project configuration file. A normal `npx forgedock` launch creates a minimal marker-bounded file in the current repository when one is absent. `/forgedock-config use Luna 5.6 with max thinking for all subagents` resolves the friendly name against the live authenticated model catalog and updates planners, workers, and reviewers while preserving unrelated legacy settings; configure `planning_model`/`planning_thinking` separately when investigation and Build Packet authoring need a different model. These defaults control role models, thinking, concurrency, and merge policy. `FORGE.md` is explicit user-maintained project guidance, and `/forgedock-remember` can persist a preference or a structured decision. `devdocs/` is a reference-only, Obsidian-compatible long-term memory graph: ForgeDock retrieves compact anchored summaries, links, and backlinks instead of loading the corpus, and memory can never authorize actions or override current intent or typed contracts. The fork is an internal interaction kernel; ForgeDock is the product identity, and its typed controller remains the sole owner of workflow transitions, verification, GitHub publication, review gates, and merge authority.

### ForgeDock Next local safety bootstrap

Mutating Next controllers require an authenticated retained lease witness. From the canonical checkout, build once and bootstrap it once:

```bash
npm run build
node bin/forgedock-next.mjs lease-witness-bootstrap
```

The command generates a non-overwriting Ed25519 key and signed checkpoint in OS-local user data, outside `.forgedock/state.db`, and writes only ignored path references to `.forgedock/lease-witness.json`. Private-key permissions are restricted where the operating system supports POSIX modes. A complete `FORGEDOCK_LEASE_WITNESS_PATH` / `FORGEDOCK_LEASE_WITNESS_PUBLIC_KEY` / `FORGEDOCK_LEASE_WITNESS_PRIVATE_KEY` environment configuration remains the highest-priority explicit override; partial configuration fails closed.

This bootstrap fences processes using one canonical checkout on one machine. It is not cross-machine or cross-checkout coordination, and copying or rolling back the SQLite database without the independently retained witness requires explicit authenticated recovery. Confirmed Deep Plan packets currently live only in the active TUI session, so finish and materialize before restarting the terminal. Detached native tasks remain locally adoptable, but loss of their owning bridge may require explicit DAG resume.

**Your AI coding agent forgets everything after every session.** It re-explores the codebase from scratch, re-makes mistakes that were already fixed, and has no idea why the code it's touching looks the way it does. ForgeDock fixes that by making **GitHub itself the memory** — every pipeline stage writes structured findings that every later agent reads.

## Without ForgeDock vs. With ForgeDock

| Without ForgeDock | With ForgeDock |
|---|---|
| Agent starts every session blind — no context from prior work | Agent reads structured investigation, root cause, and history straight from GitHub |
| The same bugs get reintroduced across PRs | Review agents surface known pitfalls from past PRs *before* you commit |
| A crash or compaction loses the run | State lives on GitHub and in an event-sourced run log — the pipeline resumes where it stopped |
| You write the issue, plan the fix, open the PR, and review it | `/work-on #42` → investigated, built, reviewed, merged |
| Review depends on whoever has capacity | 9 domain-specialist agents (security, billing, DB, concurrency…) review every PR |
| One task at a time, serialized by your attention | `/orchestrate` runs a whole milestone through a streaming DAG; compatible findings can share one pipeline |

---

## The idea in one paragraph

AI agents have **no lookback**. They don't know a function was shaped by a bug fix in #347, that an approach was tried and reverted in PR #891, or that three other files need the same change. Context window isn't the bottleneck — **memory is.** But GitHub already stores everything an agent needs: commits, PRs, issues, blame, cross-references. It's a citation graph; agents just don't use it as one. ForgeDock makes every stage write **machine-readable annotations** to issues and PRs, and every downstream agent read them. The `gh` CLI becomes the query interface to institutional memory. The result: agents that follow structured data, not vibes.

## Watch the machine work

Not a staged demo — these are real, public runs on this repository. Open any of them and read the full trail:

- **[#1230](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1230)** — the pipeline's staging review caught dead code in a feature the pipeline had shipped three hours earlier; review then caught a bug in the fix itself. Intent to merged: **30 minutes**.
- **[#1172](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1172)** — review found an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exfiltration path in the headless runner (an in-process file read bypassed the env scrub), with exact line evidence. Fixed and merged in **18 minutes**, with regression tests. A later re-review found a second-order bypass of the first fix ([#1243](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1243)) — the pipeline red-teams its own fixes.
- **[#952](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/952)** — the investigator closed the pipeline's *own proposal* as INVALID with receipts: the deliverable had already shipped weeks earlier. Zero code written, 34 minutes, full explanation.
- **[#1256](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1256)** — decomposition that respects the existing graph: it created only the two net-new sub-issues no open issue already claimed, then sequenced three existing issues into the dependency order.
- **[#1322](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1322)** — a heavyweight feature (the durable execution engine itself): 9 TDD tasks, whole-branch review caught two Criticals pre-merge, merged in **under 2 hours**.

And the part that makes it compound — the context phase citing past bugs *by number* before a line is written (from [#1196](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1196)):

> "`commands/orchestrate.md` has a dense review-finding history from PR #1081/#1107/#1126… associative-array declaration mistakes (#1113), array-element removal via pattern substitution corrupting partial matches (#1108)… the new Layer 5 subsection should not introduce a competing edge-direction convention that could reintroduce a cycle class."

> Numbers on this page are point-in-time (2026-07-04), from this repository's first 30 days of dogfooding. A reproducible cost-per-issue benchmark is a hard gate on our own launch plan — [#1264](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1264): no estimated efficiency claims.

## Orchestrate an entire milestone

`/work-on` ships one work unit. **`/orchestrate` ships a milestone.** It builds a dependency DAG and streams each ready work unit as soon as its own predecessors complete. Ordinary issues remain individual units; compatible P2/P3 review findings may be contracted into one batch issue and one `/work-on` pipeline, with all member issues closed only after the batch is verified, reviewed, and completed. On this repo's record day, that meant **29 issues taken to merged inside a single hour**.

Scheduling is conflict-aware before it is parallel. Five detection layers decide what may run concurrently: same-file overlap, directory proximity, shared-module fan-in, a conservative fallback when file extraction is low-confidence, and **historical co-change coupling mined from `git log`** — files that changed together in the past are assumed to conflict now. Database-touching issues are always serialized. The resulting graph is cycle-checked (Kahn's algorithm) and executed in topologically sorted waves; overlapping work is expressed as ordinary `Depends on #N` edges anyone can read.

```bash

```

## How it works

Each stage reads the structured output of the stages before it and writes its own findings back:

```
Issue → Investigate → Context → Architect → Build → Quality Gate → Review → Merge
              └──────────── each stage reads & writes GitHub ────────────┘
```

| Stage | Reads | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Investigate** | Issue body, `git blame`, related issues/PRs | `FORGE:INVESTIGATOR` — verdict, root cause, affected files, severity |
| **Context** | Historical findings from related PRs, known pitfalls | `FORGE:CONTEXT` — institutional memory for this module |
| **Architect** | Investigation + context | `FORGE:ARCHITECT` — ordered plan, code paths, risks |
| **Build** | Everything above | `FORGE:BUILDER` — branch, commits, files changed |
| **Quality Gate** | Builder output, domain-specific checks | gate results, recorded in the run's trajectory |
| **Review** | PR diff, contract, gate results | `FORGE:REVIEW_STARTED` on the issue; per-agent findings as structured `FINDING` blocks on the PR |
| **Close** | All of the above | `FORGE:TRAJECTORY` — the full audit trail of the run |

**GitHub as the database.** Every annotation is wrapped in an HTML comment (`<!-- FORGE:INVESTIGATOR -->`) that makes it machine-parseable. When an agent starts — even in a brand-new conversation after compaction — it queries the issue via `gh` and reconstructs full context from these tags. Workflow labels (`workflow:investigating`, `workflow:in-review`, `workflow:merged`…) track state, and the pipeline resumes from whatever state GitHub reports. The annotation format is an open standard — see the [FORGE Annotation Protocol](docs/spec/forge-protocol-v1.md).

**Durable by design.** Headless runs are backed by a real execution engine, not prompt-hope: every phase transition is appended to an event-sourced, crash-safe run log, mirrored to the issue as a compact `FORGE:STATE` index, and guarded by leases so two agents can never own the same issue. Kill the process mid-run and restart it — the engine reconciles local state against GitHub (GitHub wins), adopts branches and PRs that already exist instead of re-running the LLM, and escalates to `needs-human` after bounded retries instead of looping. Phase selection is a pure rule-based state machine: **the engine, not the model, decides what happens next.** The headless core shipped in [PR #1326](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/pull/1326); wiring the interactive path onto the same engine is in progress ([#1323](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1323)–[#1325](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1325)).

**Domain-specialist review.** Every PR is reviewed by agents with deep, narrow expertise — Security, Auth & Access Control, Billing Integrity, Database, Concurrency, Frontend, API, Performance, Infrastructure. Findings carry a confidence level, and a **reproduction gate** keeps them honest: a finding only blocks if the reviewer traced an actual code path or input that triggers it — pattern-match suspicions are downgraded, not merged into noise. Findings above the severity threshold are **automatically filed as new issues** that enter the same pipeline: on this repo, that loop produced 49% of all issues ever filed.

**It measures itself.** `/pipeline-health` correlates every prompt change against review-finding rates, build failures, and manual fix-up commits, then files its own report — including failing grades — as an issue. `/autopilot` pulls production signals (errors, CI failures, stale issues, analytics), files issues from them, and optionally runs `/work-on` on the top ones. The pipeline also invalidates its own bad ideas: proposals that turn out to be already-shipped or wrong are closed `workflow:invalid` with the reasoning attached ([example](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/952)).

## Built for the ways agents fail

Every mechanism above exists because autonomous agents fail in predictable ways. The skeptics are right about the failure modes — the answer is structure, not optimism:

| "We've all seen this go wrong…" | The mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Parallel agents just turn typing time into *reading* time | Review is a pipeline stage: domain specialists with confidence ratings and a reproduction gate — not a pile of raw diffs |
| Agents game their own checks (or delete the tests) | Builders never grade their own work — the quality gate and reviewers are separate agents reading the diff cold |
| Third retry = increasingly creative excuses | Engine-owned state machine: bounded retries, then escalation to `needs-human` |
| One runaway agent wrecks the codebase | 1 issue = 1 agent, bounded by decomposition; conflict-aware scheduling; isolated worktrees |
| No institutional memory — "it can't read the Slack thread from 2023" | Every run writes citable annotations to GitHub; the context phase quotes past bugs by number |
| No way to tell when an agent drifts | A `FORGE:TRAJECTORY` receipt on the issue records what every phase actually did |
| Humans rubber-stamp 95%-good output | Specialist review raises the floor *before* a human looks at the PR |
| The economics are opaque | ForgeDock runs on your existing Claude account — it resells no compute and takes no per-task cut. Cost-per-issue benchmarks are tracked in the open ([#1264](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1264)) |

## Commands

**The core loop:**

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **`/deep-plan`** | Confirmation-gated planning, explicit GitHub issue-DAG materialization, then a separately confirmed orchestration handoff |
| **`/work-on`** | Full issue lifecycle: investigate → build → quality gate → review → merge |
| `/orchestrate` | A whole milestone through a streaming conflict-aware DAG; compatible P2/P3 findings can share one batch pipeline |
| `/issue` | Creates pipeline-ready GitHub issues |
| `/milestone` | Create, manage, and ship milestones |
| `/review-pr` | Context-aware PR review with domain-specialist agents |
| `/quality-gate` | Pre-commit checks, gated by the domains your change actually touches |
| `/test-gate` | Acceptance verification against running code before anything deploys |

**Observe & recover** — the durable-state story, as commands:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/pipeline-status` | Fleet view of every in-flight issue, straight from workflow labels |
| `/pipeline-resume` | Resume an interrupted run from whatever state GitHub reports |
| `/diagnose` | Trace why a run failed, from its annotations |
| `/explain` | Translate the FORGE annotations on any issue into plain language |
| `/replay` | Replay a past run's full audit trail |
| `/changelog` | Release notes assembled from merged PRs and trajectory receipts |

**Ops:**

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/deploy-info` | Staging vs. main diff with risk assessment |
| `/rollback` | Automated revert PR for production incidents |
| `/autopilot` | Production signals → triaged issues → fixes |
| `/security-audit` | Multi-phase security posture audit |
| `/cleanup` | Sweeps stale issues, branches, worktrees |

More ship today (web-property analytics, browser QA sweeps, self-benchmarking) — see the [full command reference](docs/site/command-reference.md). A leaner, tiered install that keeps the core loop front and center is planned in [#1257](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1257).

## Install

**Requirements:** [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) · [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (authenticated) · Node.js ≥ 18.

```bash
npx forgedock # checks your environment, installs commands into ~/.claude/commands/ (available in every Claude Code session on this machine), detects your repo, and hands you a reviewed forge.yaml
```

For OpenCode, install namespaced native commands without changing your provider
or user-owned settings. When migrating an older ForgeDock adapter, it removes
only exact ForgeDock-managed legacy entries from `opencode.json`:

```bash
npx forgedock opencode install
# restart OpenCode, then: /forge/work-on <issue>
```

See [OpenCode support](docs/OPENCODE.md) for architecture, token-loading rules,
current parity boundaries, and lifecycle commands.

**Install is always global**, to `~/.claude/commands/`. `--global` is still accepted on the command line for backward compatibility but has no effect — there's no other install location to opt out of.

> **Want engine-mode dispatch?** `npx forgedock` is transient — the `forgedock` binary isn't persisted in PATH after install. `/orchestrate` and `/autopilot` use agent dispatch mode by default, which is fully functional. To enable engine-mode dispatch (`forgedock run-issue`) with its durable phase table and fail-closed review gate, run `npm install -g forgedock` instead.

One command does everything: it checks your environment, installs the slash commands into Claude Code, detects your repo (owner, branches, paths), and hands you a single annotated `forge.yaml` to review — press Enter to accept. Run `npx forgedock init` any time afterward to re-generate the config only.

Installing also registers a SessionStart hook, so every Claude Code session
in a forge-managed directory starts already knowing ForgeDock runs it.
Per-directory control: `npx forgedock enable` / `disable` / `status`.

Then just open Claude Code and run `/work-on <issue>`.

> **Cost:** ForgeDock is free and open-source. It orchestrates sessions on **your** Claude account — no compute resold, no per-task markup. A typical `/work-on` run on a straightforward bug costs about what a 15–20 minute manual Claude Code session does.

<details>
<summary><strong>Other install options & commands</strong></summary>

**Claude Code plugin marketplace** (Claude Code v2.1.143+):

```
/plugin marketplace add RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock
/plugin install forgedock@forgedock
```

Commands then appear as `/forgedock:work-on`, etc. You still run `npx forgedock init` to generate `forge.yaml`.

**Headless / CI:** the pipeline also runs outside Claude Code. `npx forgedock run work-on <issue> --dry-run` previews the assembled prompt and tool plan. `npx forgedock run` picks an execution backend automatically (`--backend auto`, the default): if the Claude Code CLI (`claude`) is installed and already authenticated (Pro/Max subscription or a CLI-managed key), it drives the command through that — **no separate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required**. Otherwise it falls back to the Anthropic API directly (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` required). Force either path explicitly with `--backend cli` / `--backend api` (or `FORGEDOCK_BACKEND=cli|api`) — the API backend is what CI environments without an interactive `claude` login should use. `npx forgedock run-issue <issue>` executes the same command specs on the durable engine (event-sourced run log, leases, crash-safe resume).

**Explicit install command:**

```bash
npx forgedock install           # installs into ~/.claude/commands/
npx forgedock install --global  # same thing — --global is accepted but is a no-op
```

**Maintenance:**

```bash
npx forgedock update      # relink commands + refresh the SessionStart hook
npx forgedock enable      # turn ForgeDock on for this directory
npx forgedock disable     # turn ForgeDock off for this directory
npx forgedock status      # show ForgeDock's state for this directory
npx forgedock doctor      # installation health check with fix hints
npx forgedock report      # 30-day pipeline impact receipts (--md for Markdown, --json for scripting)
npx forgedock uninstall   # remove commands, the hook, and tracked copies
npx forgedock help        # show everything
```

> Running `npx forgedock` from *inside* this repo uses the local working tree. From your own project, use `npx forgedock@latest` to pin the published release.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A note on install location</strong></summary>

ForgeDock briefly experimented with a project-scoped-by-default install mode. It was backed out after causing a "split-brain" bug (`detect` assumed project-scoped while the installer still wrote globally — [#1589](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1589)), so every version you'd realistically install today only ever writes to `~/.claude/commands/`. `--global` is still accepted as a flag for old scripts/muscle memory, but it changes nothing.

If you're carrying an older `--global` habit in scripts or CI, it's harmless to leave it — `npx forgedock --global` and `npx forgedock` do exactly the same thing.

## For companies

The core is AGPL-3.0 and stays that way: engineers run the full pipeline on their own Claude account, forever free.

Two things are for sale:

- **A [commercial license](COMMERCIAL-LICENSE.md)** — for organizations that need ForgeDock inside proprietary workflows or products without AGPL copyleft obligations. Contact [support@rapiercraftstudios.com](mailto:support@rapiercraftstudios.com).
- **The fleet layer** *(in development)* — org-wide observability over every pipeline run: the receipts on this page, live, across all your repos, plus policy controls and audit-grade provenance for autonomous merges. We're onboarding a small group of design partners — see [ForgeDock for Companies](docs/site/for-companies.md) for details and intake.

## Where it's going

Month one built the execution layer. The open roadmap — tracked in the [five-foundations epic (#1320)](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/issues/1320) — is about earning trust while unattended:

1. **Durability** — engine-owned state instead of prose-owned state. Headless core shipped ([PR #1326](https://github.com/RapierCraftStudios/ForgeDock/pull/1326)); interactive wiring in progress.
2. **Verification** — an outcome-based acceptance gate and a graded eval corpus, so "done" is machine-checkable before anything claims success. Per-release pipeline scorecards are published in [`docs/eval/`](docs/eval/README.md); model upgrades follow the [model-release playbook](docs/articles/model-release-playbook.md).
3. **Learning** — per-codebase memory that compounds across runs.
4. **Economics** — per-run cost accounting and risk×cost dispatch decisions.
5. **Provenance** — signed, replayable records of every autonomous change.
