 * comment. `FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE` is appended IN PLACE to that same
 * existing comment by `commands/work-on/build/validate.md` Phase V5 (an edit,
 * not a new comment), so no code path in this pipeline ever produces two
 * `**Branch**:` fields inside one FORGE:BUILDER:COMPLETE-eligible comment.
 * First-match and last-match are therefore equivalent for every real input;
 * first-match is kept because it's the simpler default. If a future producer
