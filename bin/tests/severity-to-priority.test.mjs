/**
 * bin/tests/severity-to-priority.test.mjs
 *
 * Unit tests for scripts/severity-to-priority.sh — the single source of truth
 * for the finding `**Severity**` -> `priority:*` label mapping.
 *
 * Regression coverage for forge#2447: commands/review-pr.md and
 * commands/review-pr-staging.md previously derived the `priority:*` label
 * from a finding's Confidence (CONFIRMED/LIKELY/POSSIBLE) instead of its
 * Severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). A finding with
 * `**Severity**: LOW` and `**Confidence**: CONFIRMED` was mislabeled
 * `priority:P1`, which defeats /orchestrate's P3 batching rule (P1/P2
 * findings are never batched).
 *
 * Also covers forge#2480: an `INFO -> priority:P3` branch was originally
 * added alongside the mapping above, but no `commands/review-pr-agents/*.md`
 * persona or finding-body template ever documented/emitted `INFO` as a valid
 * Severity value, making it permanently unreachable dead code. The branch
 * was removed from scripts/severity-to-priority.sh; `INFO` is now asserted to
 * be rejected as an unrecognized severity, same as any other invalid input.
 *
 * This suite exercises scripts/severity-to-priority.sh directly via bash
 * (mirrors the script's own `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang — works under
 * Git Bash on Windows and natively on Linux CI), asserting the full mapping
 * table plus the explicit LOW -> priority:P3 regression case named in the
 * issue.
 *
 * Run with: node --test bin/tests/severity-to-priority.test.mjs
