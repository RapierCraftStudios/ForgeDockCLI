/**
 * bin/hooks/pre-tool-use.mjs — ForgeDock PreToolUse hook.
 *
 * Deterministic enforcement layer (issues #1250, #1323): intercepts tool
 * calls before they execute and hard-blocks pipeline violations.
 *
 * === Hook protocol ===
 *
 * Claude Code sends a JSON payload to stdin and reads the exit code:
 *   exit 0  — allow the tool call
 *   exit 2  — block the tool call (error message on stderr is shown to agent)
 *
 * Input payload (stdin JSON):
 *   {
 *     "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
 *     "session_id": "...",
 *     "tool_name": "Bash",
 *     "tool_input": { "command": "gh pr create ..." }
 *   }
 *
 * === Enforced rules ===
 *
 * 1. PR branch target validation
 *    Intercepts `gh pr create` and validates `--base` against the
 *    pipeline's allowed targets (staging, milestone/<slug>).
 *    Hard-blocks PRs targeting main.
 *
 * 2. Label transition validation
 *    Intercepts `gh issue edit --add-label` and validates the transition
 *    against the workflow label state machine.
 *    Blocks invalid transitions (e.g. jumping from investigating to merged).
 *
 * 3. Declared precondition checks (from forge-invariants.yaml)
 *    Intercepts git checkout / git worktree add / git switch commands and
 *    evaluates pretooluse-scope invariants declared in forge-invariants.yaml.
 *    Currently: branch_must_exist_on_remote — blocks checkouts of branches
 *    that don't exist on origin (catches hallucinated branch names before
 *    they cause a mid-build git failure).
 *
 * 4. Gist visibility guard (issue #1729)
 *    Intercepts `gh gist create --public` and hard-blocks it.
 *    Memory-bearing pipeline gists (FORGE:KNOWLEDGE_GIST, FORGE:MILESTONE_INDEX,
 *    FORGE:PRIOR_GIST, FORGE:MEMORY_INDEX) MUST be secret — publishing them to
 *    a world-readable Gist exposes root causes, file paths, and security findings.
 *    Override: set FORGE_ALLOW_PUBLIC_GIST=1 in the shell environment before
 *    starting Claude Code (operator-set only — agents cannot bypass this by
 *    setting env vars via Bash tool calls, as this hook reads process.env which
 *    is set at process start, not at tool-call time).
 *
 * 5. Filesystem-root `find` guard (issue #2034)
 *    Intercepts any Bash command containing a `find` invocation whose search
 *    root is `/` or a bare Git-Bash drive mount (`/c`, `/d`, ...) and
 *    hard-blocks it. On Windows Git Bash, `/` spans every mounted drive, so a
 *    root-anchored `find` never terminates and accumulates as an orphaned,
 *    CPU-exhausting process once its parent sub-agent exits (issue #1984 was
 *    a narrow, single-call-site precursor fix — this rule is the systemic,
 *    deterministic follow-up). No override — a root-anchored `find` has no
 *    legitimate use in any ForgeDock pipeline.
 *
 * 6. Attribution guard
 *    Intercepts commit / PR / issue / comment creation commands (`git commit`,
 *    `gh pr create|edit|comment`, `gh issue create|edit|comment`) and
 *    hard-blocks any whose message or body carries the Claude Code harness
 *    default attribution — "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]", "Co-Authored-By:
 *    Claude", or the `noreply@anthropic.com` co-author trailer. Pipeline output
 *    is ForgeDock-branded; the assistant-tool attribution must never leak into
 *    a repo's public commit/PR/issue history. The agent is told to remove the
 *    attribution and, where a footer is wanted, use the ForgeDock signature.
 *    Override: set FORGE_ALLOW_AI_ATTRIBUTION=1 in the shell environment before
 *    starting Claude Code (operator-set only — same process.env semantics as
 *    the gist guard above).
 *
 * Rules 1-4 and 6 only apply inside a ForgeDock-managed directory (a directory
 * with a `forge.yaml` or `.forgedock` marker) — see `isForgeDockManagedCwd()`
 * (issue #1591). The hook installs into the user's global
 * `~/.claude/settings.json`, so without this guard every Bash call in every
 * repo on the machine would be subject to these ForgeDock-specific rules,
 * including unrelated repos where `main` is a legitimate PR target.
 *
 * Rule 5 is deliberately NOT gated by `isForgeDockManagedCwd()` — it runs
 * before that check. A filesystem-root `find` is a universal footgun with no
 * legitimate use anywhere (unlike Rules 1-4/6, which are ForgeDock-pipeline-
 * specific), and gating it the same way would leave it silently disabled
 * inside git worktrees, which typically carry no `forge.yaml`/`.forgedock`
 * marker of their own — exactly where build/review sub-agents run.
 *
 * === Fail-open contract ===
 *
 * Any uncaught error or parse failure exits 0 (allow) — this hook must
 * NEVER prevent a legitimate tool call due to a hook bug.
 *
 * === Wiring ===
 *
 * Installed into ~/.claude/settings.json under hooks.PreToolUse by
 * `forgedock install` (via bin/settings-hook.mjs). The install entry carries
 * `matcher: "Bash"` so Claude Code's harness only spawns this script for
 * Bash tool calls, not every tool call.
 * Removed by `forgedock uninstall`.

// Label state machine
// Valid successors for each workflow label. Only forward transitions allowed.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Allowed label transitions: from → [to, ...]
 * A label not in this map can be added freely (not a workflow: label).
 *
 * `workflow:invalid` is reachable from `ready-to-build`, `building`, and
 * `in-review` (issue #2326) — not just from `investigating` — because
 * invalidity is not always discovered where the pipeline first labels the
 * issue "ready to build". A cheap false positive is usually caught during
 * investigation; a subtler one is only disproved once the architect/build
 * phase reads the actual code and tests (see #2312: the premise wasn't
 * disproved until Phase 3C.6 read `bin/tests/engine-crash.test.mjs`).
 *
 * These three post-investigation successors are NOT unconditional, though —
 * see EVIDENCE_REQUIRED_TARGETS below and its enforcement in
 * checkLabelTransition(). Reaching `workflow:invalid` from any of these
 * three states requires a posted reversal comment (a second
 * `FORGE:INVESTIGATOR` comment carrying `**Verdict**: INVALID`) already on
 * the issue — the state machine still refuses a bare relabel with no
 * evidence trail. This preserves the original protection (see history below)
 * while making the terminal state reachable where it is actually discovered.
 *
 * History: this map was introduced by #1250/#1513 to stop arbitrary/skipped
 * label jumps (e.g. investigating → merged in one hop) — it enforces that
 * every workflow label transition follows the pipeline's real phase order,
 * with corrective error messages naming the legal next states. Widening a
 * terminal-reachability edge is safe as long as an equivalent guard (the
 * evidence precondition) replaces the blanket "not reachable at all" rule
 * for the specific case this hook was never asked to consider: legitimate,
 * evidenced invalidation discovered after ready-to-build.

 * Extract the value of a CLI flag from a command string.
 * Handles `--flag value`, `--flag=value`, and — for single-dash, single-letter
 * short flags only (e.g. `-B`, `-R`) — the attached form `-Bvalue`.
 *
 * Tokenizes the command first (see `tokenizeCommand`) and matches the flag
 * against actual argv tokens — NOT against substrings anywhere in the raw
 * command string. This prevents flag-shaped text inside a quoted argument
 * value (e.g. `--title "Fix -B main thread bug"`) from being misread as a
 * real flag (issue #1519).
 *
 * The attached form is valid getopt-style syntax that real CLIs (including
 * `gh`) accept for single-dash short flags — e.g. `gh pr create -Bmain` is
 * equivalent to `gh pr create -B main`. Without this branch, a forbidden PR
 * base written as `-Bmain` would produce no match and bypass the hard block
 * (issue #1550). The attached-form check is scoped to 2-character single-dash
 * flags so long flags (`--base`) are never affected.
 *
 * DECOY RULE: the equals form (`-B=value`/`--base=value`) and the attached
 * form (`-Bvalue`) are skipped on any token that contains EMBEDDED
 * WHITESPACE — not on any token that was merely quoted.
 *
 * A shell token can only contain whitespace if quoting was used to glue
 * multiple words into a single argument (e.g. `--title "-Bstaging is
 * fine"` — the value is a whole sentence, not a flag). That is the actual
 * signature of the issue #1519 decoy: flag-shaped text embedded inside an
 * unrelated multi-word `--title`/`--body` value. Skipping on embedded
 * whitespace preserves that protection.
 *
 * A single-word token being quoted, on the other hand, changes nothing about
 * the resulting argv entry — `"-Bmain"`, `'-Bmain'`, and `-Bmain` are all
 * identical once the shell hands the argument to `gh`, as are `--base="main"`
 * and `--base=main`. Treating "was quoted at all" as reason enough to skip
 * (the previous behaviour) let these single-word quoted forms sail through
 * untouched — a real, commonly-written bypass (issue #1591), not a decoy.
 * So quoting alone must never exempt a token from these checks; only
 * embedded whitespace does. The exact form (`token === flag`) stays
 * quote-insensitive as before: a fully-quoted `"-B"` in flag position is
 * unambiguously the flag, and its value is the next token regardless of
 * quoting.
