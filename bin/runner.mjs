/**
 * bin/runner.mjs — Standalone command runner for ForgeDock.
 *
 * Decouples ForgeDock from the Claude Code agent loop. Instead of relying on
 * Claude Code to read a `commands/*.md` spec as a slash command, this runner
 * loads the same spec, assembles a system prompt, and drives an Anthropic
 * tool-use loop directly via the Claude SDK — enabling CI/CD runs, headless
 * batch processing, and non-Claude-Code users.
 *
 * This is the foundational increment of the standalone runtime (issue #1151):
 * a generic spec-driven `run` path. Broader per-command parity, subagent
 * spawning, and streaming UI are tracked as follow-ups.
 *
 * Exports:
 *   resolveSpecPath(commandsDir, name)      → string|null   (spec file path)
 *   listCommands(commandsDir)               → string[]      (available command names)
 *   loadCommandSpec(commandsDir, name)      → {path,name,content}
 *   buildSystemPrompt(spec, opts)           → string
 *   buildCliSystemPrompt(spec)              → string        (cli-backend system prompt)
 *   buildUserMessage(name, args)            → string
 *   TOOL_DEFINITIONS                        → object[]      (Anthropic tool schemas)
 *   truncateToolResult(content)             → string        (cap + truncation marker)
 *   resolveBashShell()                      → string|undefined (explicit shell for run_bash)
 *   getToolHandlers(cwd)                    → Record<string, fn>
 *   renderDryRun(ctx)                       → string
 *   renderSummaryCard(ctx)                  → string
 *   resolveConfiguredDefaultModel(cwd)      → string|null   (forge.yaml agents.default_model, resolved)
 *   runCommand(opts)                        → Promise<{status, ...}>
 *
 * Design notes:
 *   - The Anthropic SDK is a LAZY/optional dependency: it is imported only when
 *     a live run is requested (`--dry-run` and all pure helpers need no SDK and
 *     no network), keeping `npm install`/`npm test` dependency-free.
 *   - The API key is read from ANTHROPIC_API_KEY only — never written to disk
 *     or logged.
 *   - Path resolution is Windows-safe: command names use `/` separators and are
 *     joined with `path` segments. Path traversal (`..`) is rejected.

// Bounded on two axes (issues #2057, #2058 — review findings on PR #2056):
//   1. TTL (`CLI_AVAILABILITY_CACHE_TTL_MS`): an entry older than the TTL is
//      treated as absent and re-probed, so a `claude` install/uninstall that
//      happens mid-run of a long-lived process (e.g. an orchestration loop)
//      is picked up within one TTL window instead of staying stale for the
//      rest of the process's lifetime.
//   2. Max size (`CLI_AVAILABILITY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE`): entries beyond the cap
//      evict the oldest (insertion-order, via `Map`'s iteration order and a
//      delete+re-set on refresh) so a process that probes an unbounded
//      number of distinct `cwd` values cannot grow this cache without limit.
// Each entry stores `{ available, cliPath, cachedAt }` instead of a bare
// boolean so `isClaudeCliAvailable()` can evaluate the TTL, and so the
// *same* resolved absolute executable path the probe validated can be
// reused by `runCliBackend()`'s production invocation (issue #2741) — see

/**
 * Probe whether the Claude Code CLI (`claude`) is present and responds on

 *
 * Deliberately runs a single command *string* through a shell (via
 * `execSync`) rather than `execFileSync("claude", [...])` or a no-shell
 * `spawnSync`. On Windows, `claude` may be installed as a `claude.cmd`
 * shim, or present only as an npx-transient shim (an extensionless script
 * in a `_npx` cache directory, reachable only via the shell-augmented
 * PATH); `execFileSync`/no-shell `spawnSync` do not resolve either case the
 * same way a shell does and throw ENOENT even though the CLI is genuinely
 * runnable (see issue #382 for the `.cmd`-shim regression this originally
 * guarded against, and issue #2741 for the npx-shim case). `execSync`
 * always runs its command through a shell, which resolves both cases
 * correctly on Windows and behaves identically on POSIX.
 *
 * issue #2741 — probe/invocation asymmetry fix: this probe now does double
 * duty. In a single `execImpl` call (so per-cwd caching below still pays
 * the probe cost exactly once — existing tests assert this), it both
 * verifies `claude --version` responds AND captures the shell-resolved
 * absolute path (`where claude` on Windows / `command -v claude` on POSIX)
 * that made that resolution possible. That resolved path is cached
 * alongside `available` and exposed via `resolveClaudeCliBinary()` below,
 * so `runCliBackend()`'s production call site can spawn the *exact* binary
 * this probe validated — with `shell:false` — instead of a bare `"claude"`
 * name that the no-shell OS exec-path search may fail to resolve the same
 * way. The two commands are chained with `&&` (path-resolution failure
 * short-circuits the whole probe as "unavailable") rather than run
 * independently: an environment where `claude` only resolves as an
 * unlocatable shell alias/function (no path lookup, `--version` succeeds
 * anyway) was never actually spawnable via `spawnSync` in the first place,
 * so treating that as "unavailable" here is consistent with what
 * `runCliBackend()` can actually do with it.
 *
 * Bounded by CLI_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS so a hung or misbehaving `claude` binary
 * can never make backend resolution (and therefore --dry-run, or the start
 * of a live run) hang indefinitely. Any failure — not installed, not on
 * PATH, times out, non-zero exit — is treated as "not available" and never
 * throws; the caller (resolveBackend) falls back to the API backend.
 *
 * Memoized per `cwd` for up to `CLI_AVAILABILITY_CACHE_TTL_MS` (see
 * `cliAvailabilityCache` above, issues #2011, #2057, #2058) — the first call
 * for a given `cwd` pays the probe cost; every subsequent call for that same
 * `cwd` within the TTL window returns the cached result instantly, with no
 * new child process spawned. Once the TTL elapses the entry is treated as
 * absent and re-probed, and the cache never grows past
 * `CLI_AVAILABILITY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` distinct `cwd` entries (oldest evicted
 * first).

 * ignored, and (b) what to return when the CLI probe fails (`resolveBackend`

 * only if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, else `"none"`). Rather than force
 * those into one shape, this shared helper implements exactly the common
 * two steps and defers to a `cliFallback` callback for the diverging tail,
 * and defers override *validation* (throw vs. fall-through) entirely to

/**
 * Run a command via the local Claude Code CLI instead of the Anthropic SDK
 * (issue #2003's "cli" backend). Shells out to headless print mode
 * (`claude --print "<message>" --dangerously-skip-permissions`), reusing
 * whatever the CLI is already authenticated with — no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is
 * read or required anywhere on this path.
 *
 * SECURITY — argv array, NEVER `shell: true`: `userMessage` is built from
 * `buildUserMessage(commandName, args)`, and `args` originates from
 * user-supplied CLI arguments to `forgedock run <command> <args...>` — it is
 * untrusted input from this function's point of view. `spawnSync("claude",
 * [...argv], { shell: false (default) })` passes each argument as a discrete,
 * unparsed argv element: the target process receives `userMessage` as one
 * literal string, with no shell ever tokenizing or expanding it, so shell
 * metacharacters (`$(...)`, backticks, `;`, `&&`, `|`, `!`) inside it cannot
 * trigger command injection. An earlier version of this function built a
 * shell command *string* (`claude --print "<quoted message>" ...`) run via
 * `spawnSync(command, { shell: true })` with hand-rolled quoting
 * (backslash/double-quote escaping only) — that does NOT neutralize
 * `$(...)`/backtick/`!` expansion inside POSIX double quotes and was an
 * exploitable injection (verified: a crafted `userMessage` could execute
 * arbitrary shell commands with this process's privileges). Do not
 * reintroduce `shell: true` or string-command interpolation here.
 *
 * Windows npm `.cmd`/`.bat` shims cannot be launched by Node with
 * `shell:false`. `resolveDirectCliExecutable()` therefore parses only the
 * strict npm-shim form that delegates directly to a native `.exe`/`.com` and
 * returns that trusted target. Unknown batch scripts fail closed instead of
 * requiring cmd.exe interpolation of the untrusted user message.
 *
 * CORRECTED (issue #2741): the claim that a bare `"claude"` name resolves
 * via "spawnSync's own PATH/PATHEXT resolution" was overconfident and
 * false for an npx-transient shim (an extensionless script living in a
 * `_npx` cache directory rather than a stable PATH entry with a registered
 * PATHEXT extension) — `spawnSync(shell:false)` resolves a bare command
 * name via the OS's own exec-path search, which does not carry the same
 * shell/PATHEXT semantics `isClaudeCliAvailable()`'s shell-based probe
 * uses, and ENOENTs on that shim even though the probe reports the CLI
 * available. The fix is NOT `shell: true` (would reopen the injection hole
 * above); it is resolving the *exact* absolute path the probe validated
 * once, via `resolveClaudeCliBinary()`, and passing that resolved path as
 * `bin` — `spawnSync(shell:false)` launches an already-fully-resolved
 * native executable path (including the target extracted from a recognized
 * npm shim) without needing any further PATH/PATHEXT
 * resolution of its own. See `isClaudeCliAvailable()`/
 * `resolveClaudeCliBinary()` above for how that resolution happens.
 *
 * `--dangerously-skip-permissions` mirrors the established headless-CI
 * invocation pattern already documented in docs/CI.md and
 * templates/workflows/forgedock-review.yml: without it, the CLI would block
 * on an interactive permission prompt that a headless caller can never
 * answer, hanging until FORGEDOCK_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS/DEFAULT_CLI_TIMEOUT_MS
 * kills it.
 *
 * SYSTEM PROMPT / COMMAND SPEC DELIVERY (issue #2019): `systemPrompt` (built
 * by `buildCliSystemPrompt(spec)` — see below) is written to a private
 * temp file and forwarded via `--append-system-prompt-file <path>`, NOT
 * passed inline as a `--system-prompt`/`--append-system-prompt` argv string.
 * Two reasons this matters:
 *   1. Size: a command spec like `commands/work-on.md` is 100+ KB, and the
 *      full `commands/*.md` corpus is over 1MB. Windows' CreateProcess has a
 *      ~32K character command-line limit; spawnSync here uses `shell: false`
 *      so it hits that OS-level argv limit directly. A file path is always
 *      short regardless of spec size.
 *   2. Semantics: `--append-system-prompt-file` *appends* to the CLI's own
 *      default system prompt (tool descriptions, environment info, etc.),
 *      matching how a real `/work-on` slash-command invocation inside Claude
 *      Code behaves — the ForgeDock spec augments the CLI's native
 *      capabilities rather than replacing them. `--system-prompt-file` would
 *      instead *replace* the CLI's default prompt entirely, which would
 *      strip the CLI of its own operating instructions.
 * The temp file lives in a per-call `mkdtempSync` directory and is always
 * removed in a `finally` block, covering the timeout/spawn-error/non-zero-exit
 * paths as well as the success path.
 *
 * Model selection is intentionally NOT forwarded to the CLI in this first
 * increment — the CLI backend uses whatever model the `claude` CLI itself is
 * configured for. `opts.model`/FORGEDOCK_MODEL only affects the API backend.
 *
 * Token usage: the invocation requests `--output-format json`, and on a
 * successful exit the captured stdout is parsed as the CLI's single-result
 * JSON envelope. When parsing succeeds and the envelope carries a `usage`
 * object, it is normalized to the same shape the API backend returns
 * (`{input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens,
 * cache_read_input_tokens}`, each field `?? 0`). When the output isn't valid
 * JSON (older CLI versions, or a CLI that ignores `--output-format`) or the
 * envelope has no `usage` field, this degrades gracefully to `usage: null`
 * (an already fully-supported value throughout renderSummaryCard/renderDryRun)
 * — this parsing never throws on the success path.
 *
 * @param {object} opts
 * @param {{path: string, name: string, content: string}} opts.spec
 * @param {string} opts.userMessage
 * @param {string} [opts.systemPrompt] - CLI-appropriate system prompt (see
 *   `buildCliSystemPrompt`), forwarded via `--append-system-prompt-file`.
 *   Omitted/empty is tolerated (no flag is added) so existing callers that
 *   have not been updated yet do not break, but production callers should
 *   always supply it — see issue #2019.
 * @param {string[]} [opts.args]
 * @param {string} opts.cwd
 * @param {{log: Function, error?: Function}} [opts.logger]
 * @param {string} [opts.bin] - Executable to invoke (default "claude").
 *   UPDATED (issue #2741): the real production caller (`runCommand()`
 *   below) now deliberately passes `resolveClaudeCliBinary(cwd) ?? "claude"`
 *   here — a pre-resolved absolute path, not the bare default — to close
 *   the probe/invocation asymmetry described on `isClaudeCliAvailable()`
 *   above. The bare `"claude"` default remains purely a fallback for that
 *   production call site (when resolution genuinely finds nothing) and a
 *   test seam: tests still point this at a controlled fake binary instead
 *   of either invoking the real `claude` CLI (slow, non-deterministic, real
 *   side effects) or fighting platform-specific PATH-resolution semantics
 *   to shim "claude" itself (Windows resolves a bare executable name via
 *   the *calling* process's search path at the OS level, which is not
 *   reliably overridable per-call from within the same process).
 * @param {Function} [opts.spawnFn] - Injectable replacement for
 *   `child_process.spawnSync` (default `spawnSync`). Test seam only —
 *   production callers must never override this. Mirrors the identical
 *   `spawnFn` seam on `bin/init-enrich-cli.mjs`'s `enrich()` (issue #2033):
 *   both functions spawn the local `claude` CLI in headless print mode, so
 *   sharing the same seam shape lets tests exercise both with equivalent
 *   fixtures and makes future divergence between the two easier to catch.
 *   This is additive to the existing `bin` override seam above — tests may
 *   still use a real fake-binary-on-disk + real `spawnSync` (the original
 *   seam), or fully mock the call via `spawnFn` (no fake binary needed).
 * @returns {{status: string, command: string, iterations: number, stopReason: string, usage: ({input_tokens: number, output_tokens: number, cache_creation_input_tokens: number, cache_read_input_tokens: number}|null), model: string, backend: "cli"}}

 *
 * The lexical checks above only inspect the path *string* — they do not
 * protect against a symlink pre-existing inside cwd (planted by an earlier
 * tool call, or already present on disk) that lexically resolves inside cwd
 * but dereferences at the OS level to a location outside it. To close that
 * gap, the resolved path's *real* (symlink-free) location is also checked
 * against the *real* cwd before returning. write_file targets frequently
 * don't exist yet (its mkdirSync call runs after this function returns), so
 * realpathSync would throw ENOENT if run on the leaf directly — this walks
 * up to the nearest existing ancestor, resolves *that*, and rejoins the
 * non-existent remainder. Unlike bin/registry.mjs's normalizeDir() (a

  //
  // This is acceptable under the current threat model because:
  //   1. Tool calls are executed in a strictly sequential, synchronous

  //      need to schedule two tool calls simultaneously, which the loop
  //      prevents.
  //   3. Only an independent, external OS process running concurrently could
  //      exploit the window, which is outside the stated single-shot
  //      prompt-injection threat model.
  //
  // If the runner is ever refactored to execute tool calls concurrently or
  // asynchronously, this assumption MUST be revisited.  Mitigations to
  // consider at that point include: operating on `realResolved` directly
  // (eliminating the lexical/realpath split), or opening the file with an
  // O_NOFOLLOW-equivalent flag so the kernel rejects a symlink at open time.
