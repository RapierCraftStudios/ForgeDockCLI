# OpenCode Support

ForgeDock's OpenCode integration uses native OpenCode commands, subagents, and
plugins while keeping `commands/**/*.md` as the only workflow source of truth.
The older global-instructions and `opencode.json` patching adapter has been
retired because it loaded ForgeDock prose into unrelated sessions, registered
only four commands, used the wrong argument placeholder, and assumed OpenCode
had neither skills nor subagents.

## Install

```bash
npx forgedock opencode install
```

For the optional command tier:

```bash
npx forgedock opencode install --extras
```

Restart OpenCode after install or update. OpenCode loads commands, skills, and
plugins at startup.

The installer does not edit `opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`. It writes only
ForgeDock-owned files under OpenCode's config directory and records them in
`forgedock/manifest.json` for safe updates and removal.

## Usage

Commands are namespaced to avoid collisions:

```text
/forge/work-on 967
/forge/review-pr 123
/forge/quality-gate
/forge/orchestrate milestone checkout-v2
```

Headless OpenCode invocation uses the same command names:

```bash
opencode run --command forge/work-on "967"
```

## Architecture

The installed command files are thin entry adapters. A command loads exactly
one authoritative spec from ForgeDock's stable installation and translates
runtime mechanics without copying workflow behavior.

```text
OpenCode /forge/work-on
  -> small generated command adapter
  -> commands/work-on.md
  -> only the nested phase spec reached by the dispatcher
  -> GitHub labels and FORGE annotations remain durable state
```

The generated plugin has no prompt text. It:

- injects `FORGE_HOME` into OpenCode shell environments;
- defaults `subagent_depth` to 2 when the user has not configured it, while
  preserving explicit lower limits;
- selects Git Bash on Windows only when the user has not explicitly configured
  an OpenCode shell, because the shared workflows and helper scripts use Bash.

The adapter also registers every eligible ForgeDock workflow as a native
OpenCode skill. Top-level and nested source paths are normalized to valid
hyphenated skill names while the wrapper continues to point at the authoritative
source file:

```text
commands/work-on.md             -> skills/work-on/SKILL.md
commands/work-on/investigate.md -> skills/work-on-investigate/SKILL.md
commands/review-pr.md           -> skills/review-pr/SKILL.md
```

The wrapper is intentionally thin. It carries the workflow's `name` and
`description` frontmatter, preserves the current-context arguments, and loads
only the referenced `commands/**/*.md` spec.

OpenCode's provider configuration remains entirely user-owned. ForgeDock does
not require Anthropic when invoked through OpenCode; any provider and model
supported by the user's OpenCode configuration can execute the commands.

## Token Efficiency

The adapter follows these rules:

- No global ForgeDock `instructions` entry.
- Top-level user entry commands are registered under `/forge/*`.
- Every eligible workflow is registered as a native skill so nested
  `Skill(...)` dispatch resolves through OpenCode's `skill` tool instead of
  filesystem guessing.
- Nested phase specs are loaded only when their dispatcher reaches them.
- Task/Agent work uses OpenCode subagents only for the parallelism, isolation,
  or context-pressure cases required by the shared workflow.
- GitHub state and the durable engine remain the recovery source instead of
  replaying prior prompt context.

The generated adapter preamble is intentionally small. It maps Claude Code's
in-conversation `Skill(...)` loading to the normalized native skill name and
authoritative shared spec. It maps isolated `Task(...)` and permitted
`Agent(...)` calls to OpenCode's native `task` tool.

`commands/work-on.md` is still a large entry dispatcher and is loaded in full,
matching the Claude Code path. The adapter prevents additional eager loading,
but reducing that entry cost requires decomposing the shared authoritative spec
rather than maintaining an OpenCode-only copy.

## Lifecycle

```bash
npx forgedock opencode status
npx forgedock opencode install          # update/repair
npx forgedock opencode install --extras
npx forgedock opencode uninstall
```

Updates are deterministic and prune stale ForgeDock-owned command files.
Uninstall removes only files listed in the ownership manifest and still marked
with a ForgeDock sentinel. User-owned commands, plugins, and files placed in
the `forgedock/` namespace are never removed; that namespace is pruned only
when it is empty.
Install also removes the previous ForgeDock-managed `~/.opencode-forge.md`
instructions file and its exact legacy config entries when they are present.

## Locations

Default global location:

```text
~/.config/opencode/
  commands/forge/*.md
  skills/<workflow-name>/SKILL.md
  plugins/forgedock.js
  forgedock/manifest.json
```

`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` are honored when set. An npm/npx
installation first persists the required ForgeDock payload under `~/.forge` so
generated commands never point into an evictable package cache. A stable Git
clone is referenced directly.

## Current Boundary

This integration provides native interactive command and subagent execution.
The separate `forgedock run` and `forgedock run-issue` backend still supports
only Claude CLI and the Anthropic API. An OpenCode engine backend must be added
and validated before ForgeDock can claim provider-neutral headless parity.

The ForgeDock plugin provides the OpenCode-specific runtime boundary for shell
execution. Its `tool.execute.before` hook rejects Claude-backed and recursive
ForgeDock controller commands; the shared workflow rules and deterministic
scripts remain the source of truth for all other behavior.

OpenCode 1.18.4 keeps background subagents experimental. When they are not
enabled, the command adapter requires independent foreground tasks to be
launched concurrently where supported and uses ForgeDock's GitHub-label polling
fallback. This preserves isolated review contexts but does not yet prove equal
wall-clock behavior for `/forge/orchestrate`.

Commands that inspect Claude-specific transcripts or Claude installation state
remain runtime-specific and should not be represented as portable until they
receive dedicated implementations.

## Orchestration Runtime

OpenCode orchestration uses the native OpenCode `task` tool for isolated issue
work and follows the shared `commands/work-on.md` state machine. It must not
route through `forgedock run-issue` when that would select the Claude CLI or
Anthropic API backend. If the host does not expose an OpenCode runtime marker,
set the runtime explicitly before launching a headless command:

```bash
FORGE_RUNTIME=opencode opencode run --command forge/orchestrate "fast-lane"
```

Each task re-reads GitHub labels and `FORGE:*` comments after every phase and
continues until `workflow:merged`, `workflow:invalid`, `needs-human`, or
`workflow:awaiting-merge`. If native task dispatch is unavailable, post a
`FORGE:OPENCODE_BLOCKED` diagnostic naming the missing capability and add
`needs-human`; do not leave an issue stranded at `workflow:engine-error`.

If a generated command or skill cannot load its authoritative workflow, it must
stop with an actionable `FORGE_OPENCODE_CAPABILITY_ERROR`. It must not recover
by invoking `forgedock run-issue`, `npx forgedock run-issue`, or a recursive
`opencode run`; those paths select a competing controller or Claude-backed
backend.

The same boundary is enforced below the plugin for direct CLI callers. With
`FORGE_RUNTIME=opencode`, `forgedock run`, `forgedock run-issue`, and Claude
backend preflight fail before selecting a provider. The stable error is
`FORGE_OPENCODE_CAPABILITY_ERROR`; continue by using the registered native
Skill and Task workflow instead.

This runtime branch is additive. Claude keeps its existing engine and
background-agent paths, and Codex keeps its installed namespaced skills and
repo-local adapters.

## Runtime Paths

The shared orchestration spec resolves `classify-lane.sh` by runtime:

| Runtime | Helper precedence | Worktree root |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Claude | `${FORGE_HOME}/scripts`, then `~/.claude/scripts`, then the repository `scripts/` | `.claude/worktrees/` |
| OpenCode | `${FORGE_HOME}/scripts`, then the repository `scripts/`, then `~/.opencode/scripts` | `.opencode/worktrees/` |
| Codex | `${FORGE_HOME}/scripts`, then the repository `scripts/` | `.codex/worktrees/` |

Set `FORGE_RUNTIME=opencode` for headless OpenCode sessions when no native
OpenCode marker is available. The resolver is used by initial dispatch and all
review-finding classification loops, so an OpenCode installation never needs
`~/.claude` while the Claude precedence and fallback remain unchanged.
