# Workflow Reference

Canonical reference for configuring and querying the GitHub Projects v2 field IDs and option IDs used by ForgeDock commands.

---

## Project Board Integration

ForgeDock commands add issues to a GitHub Projects v2 board and update fields (Status, Lane, Component, Priority, Workflow) as issues move through the pipeline.

**All board IDs are project-specific.** You cannot reuse IDs from another project. Use the discovery commands below to find yours, or run `/forgedock-init` which does this automatically.

---

## Configuration

Project board IDs are stored in `forge.yaml` under the `project_board` section. See [`docs/CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md#project_board-optional) for the full schema.

```yaml
project_board:
  owner: "your-org"
  project_number: 1
  project_id: "PVT_kwHOxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

  field_ids:
    status: "PVTSSF_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    lane: "PVTSSF_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    component: "PVTSSF_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    priority: "PVTSSF_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    workflow: "PVTSSF_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

  option_ids:
    status:
      todo: "xxxxxxxx"
      in_progress: "xxxxxxxx"
      done: "xxxxxxxx"
    lane:
      fast: "xxxxxxxx"
      feature: "xxxxxxxx"
      sync: "xxxxxxxx"
    priority:
      p0: "xxxxxxxx"
      p1: "xxxxxxxx"
      p2: "xxxxxxxx"
      p3: "xxxxxxxx"
    workflow:
      investigating: "xxxxxxxx"
      building: "xxxxxxxx"
      in_review: "xxxxxxxx"
      merged: "xxxxxxxx"

  components:
    - repo: "your-org/your-repo"
      option_id: "xxxxxxxx"
      label: "Platform"
```

## Native orchestration phases

Fresh native orchestrations may use the investigation-first path. The controller freezes the selected issue, route, and base evidence, dispatches one read-only investigation per issue concurrently, and persists an exact wave barrier. Invalid issues are settled individually and confirmed issues are materialized into the execution DAG only after every wave member settles. Observer snapshots report `investigating set · barrier completed/expected` before switching to `executing DAG`. Existing durable execution DAG records continue to resume through the scheduler unchanged.

## Finding Your IDs

### Step 1 — Find your project number and project ID

```bash
# List all projects owned by your org or user
gh project list --owner <your-org-or-username> --format json \
  | jq '.projects[] | {number: .number, id: .id, title: .title}'
```

The `id` value is your `project_id` (`PVT_...`). The `number` is used in all subsequent queries.

### Step 2 — List field IDs

```bash
gh project field-list <project_number> --owner <your-org-or-username> --format json \
  | jq '.fields[] | {name: .name, id: .id}'
```

Each field's `id` value (`PVTSSF_...`) maps to a key under `field_ids` in your `forge.yaml`.

### Step 3 — List option IDs for single-select fields

```bash
# Get all options for a specific field (e.g. Status)
gh project field-list <project_number> --owner <your-org-or-username> --format json \
  | jq '.fields[] | select(.name == "Status") | .options[] | {name: .name, id: .id}'
```

Repeat for each field (Lane, Priority, Workflow, Component). The 8-character hex IDs are your `option_ids` values.

---

## Automated Setup

Running `/forgedock-init` in Claude Code walks you through the full setup interactively: it queries your project board, extracts all field and option IDs, and writes them to `forge.yaml` automatically.

---

## Usage Pattern

Once IDs are in `forge.yaml`, ForgeDock reads them at runtime. The pattern used by commands:

```bash
# Add issue to project board
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-add <project_id> --owner <owner> --url "$ISSUE_URL" \
  --format json --jq '.id')

# Set Status field
gh project item-edit --project-id <project_id> --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id <status_field_id> --single-select-option-id <todo_option_id> \
  2>/dev/null || true

# Set Lane field
gh project item-edit --project-id <project_id> --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id <lane_field_id> --single-select-option-id <fast_option_id> \
  2>/dev/null || true

# On merge: set Status=Done and Workflow=Merged
gh project item-edit --project-id <project_id> --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id <status_field_id> --single-select-option-id <done_option_id> \
  2>/dev/null || true
gh project item-edit --project-id <project_id> --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id <workflow_field_id> --single-select-option-id <merged_option_id> \
  2>/dev/null || true
```

All `<placeholder>` values come from your `forge.yaml` — commands read `forge.yaml` and substitute them at runtime.

## Adding a Component Field

The Component field maps each repository in your project to a selectable option. For each repo you track:

1. Create a single-select option in your GitHub project's Component field (via the project UI)
2. Query the new option's ID:
   ```bash
   gh project field-list <project_number> --owner <owner> --format json \
     | jq '.fields[] | select(.name == "Component") | .options[]'
   ```
3. Add an entry under `components` in `forge.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   components:
     - repo: "your-org/your-repo"
       option_id: "xxxxxxxx"
       label: "Platform"
   ```
